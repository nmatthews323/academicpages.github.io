I recently submitted my PhD in Science Technology and Innovation Policy at the University of Manchester. My PhD research has focussed on the sustainability assessment and the sustainable governance of emerging technologies, with particular focus on Synthetic Biology (sometimes called Engineering Biology). I have published peer-reviewed academic articles in a variety of disciplines including sustainability, public policy, and biology.

A common theme amongst my research, my work, and my voluntary activities is a desire to create more effective systems and processes for delivering societally desirable outcomes. I intend to pursue a career that utilises these experiences to help support society to transition to being more sustainable and equitable.

On this site you can find more information about me, my work, and very occasional blog posts. Feel to get in contact through the links on the left.
