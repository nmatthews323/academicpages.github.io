I am a PhD student at the Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, University of Manchester. I am also affiliated to the [Sustainable Industrial Systems](http://www.sustainable-systems.org.uk/) (SIS) group within the School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science and am a member of the [Responsible Research and Innovation](http://synbiochem.co.uk/responsible-research-and-innovation/) group in the Manchester Synthetic Biology Research Centre ([SynBioChem](http://http://synbiochem.co.uk)).
My PhD is entitled *Constructive sustainability assessment: implementing a responsible research and innovation approach for synthetic biology"* and my supervisors are [Professor Philip Shapira](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/pshapira.html) and [Dr Laurence Stamford](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/laurence-stamford(ce5ed440-a6f0-4b25-b8d5-80a3ee2fbfc2).html).
Through my research I am developing ways to carry out sustainability assessments of emerging technologies like synthetic biology and low-technology readiness levels in a manner that is in line with the principles of responsible research and innovation. Thorough application and testing of my approaches in a variety of contexts will culminate in a framework for constructive sustainability assessment.

My PhD situates me at the interface of the natural and social sciences, which I think is essential when studying the complex and "wicked" challenge of sustainability. On the one hand I develop and apply techniques typical such as process modelling and life-cycle methods for evaluating sustainability of specific products. Meanwhile I also engage in deliberative activities and other qualitative methods more typical of the social sciences, exploring the process through which we carry out sustainability assessments.

I started the PhD after doing a BA in Natural Sciences and a MSci in Systems Biology, both at the University of Cambridge. 
By shifting fields I have been able to look at the "bigger picture" of science, and study how scientific and technological developments can impact on the environment and wider society.
After completing my PhD I want to continue to build on this work, helping to link science with society, and help ensure that science delivers on the promises it makes.

Outside of my PhD research I remain facinated by biology and passionate about sustainability. 
I enjoy pretty much any physical activity, whether it be running, hiking, squash, skiing.
